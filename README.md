# 💳 Fraud Detection Engine with Explainable AI (SHAP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Fraud Detection Engine** using machine learning techniques to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions.
The system combines **supervised learning**, **anomaly detection**, and **explainable AI (SHAP)** to deliver accurate predictions with transparent explanations.

Developed as part of an **Selected Topics coursework**, the project includes a fully deployed **Streamlit web application**.
